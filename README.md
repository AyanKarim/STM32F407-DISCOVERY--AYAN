## Embedded Systems - STM32F407VGTx
#### I am providing some  codes regarding Embedded Systems on STM32F407VGTx which is ARM Cortex M4 based microcontroller. Although some parts of the codes are written with help of HAL Libraries, I am trying to code them all in Low Level.

###### *stm32f407_accelerometer.c shows how to get the information from the on board accelerometer through SPI interface. As a result of the code, on boards LEDs get enabled according to the acceleration direction.
